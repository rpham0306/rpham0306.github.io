title: "Boba Bot"
excerpt: "I created a Discord Bot utilizing discord.py and Riot API in order to allow users to create custom League of Legend games. The bot requires users to link a League of Legends account in order to track their amount of games played and their in-game rank. Then, users can !create custom League of Legend matches that organize users into 2 teams of 5. Team leaders are randomly chosen and teams are randomly formed to ensure fairness. Each users wins and losses are tracked with the addition of a Boba Point system in order to promote a competiive environment. The bot also has a !leaderboard system which allows users to find their ranks with other users in the Discord! <br/><img src='/images/uploaded/boba_bot_outside.png'>"
