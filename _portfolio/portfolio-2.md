title: "Boba Bot"
excerpt: "I developed Discord bot using discord.py and the Riot API that allows players to link their League of Legends accounts for match history and rank tracking. The bot organizes users into two balanced teams of five—randomly assigning team leaders to ensure fairness—tracks wins and losses through a competitive Boba Point system, and provides a real‑time leaderboard command for comparing player standings. <br/><img src='/images/uploaded/boba_bot_outside.png'>"
