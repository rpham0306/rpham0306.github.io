Hi! My names Ryan Pham, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Houston, graduating in May 2026. I am passionate about solving problems through code and currently exploring interests in backend development, cloud computing, and data analysis. I enjoy learning and diving into new technologies and building solutions that can create a meaningful an impact.

Recently, I collaborated with a team to develop a website that simulates the University of Houston's student portal. We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with PostgreSQL to build interactive forms that students can complete. The platform also includes functionality for department administrators to approve or deny submissions, simulating real workflow oversight.

Currently, I am looking for any potential internship and co-op opportunities for Summer and Fall 2025 where I can apply and improve my technical skills in a team-oriented environment as a developer.

Outside of tech, I enjoy gaming, expanding my palate through new cuisines, and running. Iâ€™m a proud Yelp Elite member, love discovering hidden food gems around Houston, and am currently training for the Houston Chevron Marathon. Lately, I have been playing Marvel Rivals!

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-pham0306)! I'm always open to conversations and opportunities.
