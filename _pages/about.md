Hi! My name is Ryan Pham, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Houston, graduating in May 2026. I am passionate about solving problems through coding and currently exploring interests in backend development, cloud computing, and data analytics. I enjoy learning and diving into new technologies and building solutions that can create a meaningful impact.

Recently, I collaborated with a team to develop a website that simulates the University of Houston's student portal. We utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with PostgreSQL to build interactive forms that students can complete. The platform also included functionalities for department administrators to approve or deny submissions, simulating real workflow oversight.

Currently, I am looking for a potential internship or co-op opportunities for Summer and Fall 2025 where I can apply my technical skills in a team-oriented environment as a developer.

Outside of technology, I enjoy gaming, expanding my palate through new cuisines, and running. Iâ€™m a proud Yelp Elite member who loves discovering hidden food gems around Houston. I am also currently training for the Houston Chevron Marathon, and lately, I have been playing Marvel Rivals!

I also enjoy networking with others to gain new experiences and solve challenges through teamwork and innovation. One of my personal goals is to introduce someone new everyday - I believe that every conversation holds growth and opportunity. I'm always excited to share, connect, and learn from others.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-pham0306)! I'm always open to conversations and opportunities.
